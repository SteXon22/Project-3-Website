                            <h3>Alvin:</h3>
                            <p>While we did manage to get the job done in the end, the group had its ups and downs especially through attendance. Everyone completed the work they were allocated in time before submission and were also very supportive and engaging to other concerns that other group members had. The connection and bond developed very quickly through similar interests and coincidences. Communication was amazing especially with a bigger group and different schedules for each member. The major concern was the startup phase of the group development where it had to reach certain members or there were issues with facebook groups not receiving messages for certain members. Some members couldn’t attend meeting agendas due to conflicts with their schedules but manageable in the end. What was most surprising was that every member managed to complete the task they were allocated in the short amount of time and also the lack of communication in some areas. The one thing learnt within the group was how closely related/connected we all were through areas like friends of family or even living on the same block. The communication was there when needed and everyone was willing and able to help out and it is hard to first start off with making sure everyone is doing the work, attending meetings and allocating time to suit everyone's needs.</p><br>
                            <h3>Steven:</h3>
                            <p>The group had a rocky start into the project but ended up being very successful and on top of their work towards the end of the assignment. This group was able to get their allocated work done on time and was able to deliver what was expected of them, allowing progression of the project to smoothly advance. The group was able to freely discuss amongst each other about work both related and not related to the project, showing a close connection between group members. What was most surprising during this assignment was how well some members were able to stay on top of their communication with one another, showing instant replies and responses to each other's questions about the assignment. Despite the great communication, one thing I learnt about group work is how difficult it is for all members to be free at the same time to discuss or hold full meetings as each individual has their own separate life outside of university times, which is the only con about this group as every meeting will consist of a missing member.

                            <h3>Prerak:</h3>
                            <p>The group was able to work together efficiently and effectively with each group member once allocated work completing the task to a high standard and within the time constraint placed on each task. An area of improvement for the group as a whole would be our attendance for some meetings and class time in order to communicate and coordinate in a more effective manner rather than rely on text messages whether it be on teams or Facebook messenger. A surprise was everyone’s eagerness to participate and put in effort, usually in group tasks in my experience there is always someone who doesn’t put in effort and so proves to be a liability to the team however this group proved to have no liabilities. A learning experience that I can take away from working within this group is to improve my time management skills when completing tasks as I would often procrastinate the tasks given to me. The tools used such as Teams allowed us to document our meetings and were simple enough to use, however, GitHub proved to be more of a challenge for most of our group. Using some of the functions of GitHub and making sure our work appeared required some time and assistance from other group members, but the issue was solved.

                            <h3>Denzel:</h3>
                            <p>The Assignment started off fairly chaotic, but we were able to properly get our work done towards the submission date. Everyone was able to complete their tasks, no matter what it was with no fuss. Once we were able to properly meet with each other it was surprising to me that there was a clear connection with each member, which I think allowed us to work with each other more comfortably. We could have definitely improved by breaking up our time more effectively, and doing proper meetings, allocations, and even setting deadlines for work. Since our schedules didn't exactly line up, it was far easier communicating with each other in an informal way, rather than just talking in allocated meetings or in class. Working on this project together, I have learned how effective it is to build a rapport with each other, especially when working on a large project. Using Microsoft Teams was also surprisingly effective, as it allowed us to properly schedule meetings, and even review them if we needed. However, I think using GItHub, especially as a group, was something completely new to everyone, and proved to be more of a struggle than a boon, but in figuring out how to properly use it, I can see how valuable it is as a service.</p><br>
                            <h3>Rain:</h3>
                            <p>Overall, we are doing a great job for this group assignment, most of our team members can join the group meetings together but still, some of the members may miss one of the meetings, and we create multiple meetings for different stages of the assignment. All our team members can finish their parts for each of the stages. The only thing that needs to be improved is we may have to have a better reminder of the meeting's time. Because sometimes few team members may forget about the meeting times and miss the meeting, and we need to talk to them about what we discussed for the meetings and what things need to be done. Things that were surprising is all of the team members did a great job to finish their parts in time. Because some teamwork I done before always have someone didn’t corporate anything for the teamwork. For this assignment one thing I learned is communication, sometimes one team members need some support, and other members help them to make them is the right track also can keep the assignment at a higher mark. Github also helps us also for teamwork, Github not only can allow us to edit the website at the same time, but it also has the history feature that can allow us to roll back to the previous visions if we are making something wrong. </p><br>
                            <h3>Zhipeng:</h3>
                            <p>I’m proud to work with these guys as a team, and they are all good members, they can separate the mission into different parts and can discuss who to do which part. Everyone is kind to each other and can help with their difficulties. Like me, I’ve been infected by Covid-19 this whole week, so I can't go to the meetings. So one of my teammates helped me by talking with other team members to  give some easy tasks to do. But finally, we finished our team work and learned a lot from this teamwork. Although the meetings are very funny because at almost all times, we can’t  join into the meeting and the time is always changing. And I can’t join the meetings for most because of the Covid-19.</p><br>
