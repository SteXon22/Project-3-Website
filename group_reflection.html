                            <p>Everyone has improved tremendously from project 2, more initiative can be seen, less procrastination, and more quality of work. This group was able to get their allocated work done on time and was able to deliver what was expected of them, allowing the project to be completed early with only the website and editing to get done. It was nice to see the group was more transparent about their progress on their task, as it gave us a greater overview of what stage of the assignment we were at. The group was able to freely discuss amongst each other about the assignment.. What was most surprising during this assignment was how well all members were communicating outside of our allocated team meeting times/ class times, as questions were being asked and answers were being given about the assignment. Despite the great communication, one thing I learnt about group work is how difficult it is for all members to be free at the same time to discuss or hold full meetings as each individual has their own separate life outside of university times, which is the only con about this group as every meeting will consist of a missing member.</p>
                            <h3>Alvin: </h3>
                            <p>Communication has been far greater than the previous assignments, where roles were allocated efficiently and the work done was smooth. The group was able to finish their tasks in time without complaints, any complications or issues that were raised were quickly solved through good communication and ability to work as a team. One thing that could be improved can be the level of work output and also the quality, a clearer understanding of the tasks at hand and also the project ideas can be better for different individuals on how they can structure their work. The one thing that was surprising was how everyone was able to finish their tasks quickly compared to the last assignment where everything wasn’t left to the last minute. Fast responses, quick action and good team effort all played part into the completion of this task. One thing I learnt about the group is that getting everyone’s attention and allocating tasks efficiently allows for the tasks to be done quickly, which benefits everyone as it wouldn’t be left to the last minute. Having someone that leads the group can help clear up any miscommunication and also figure out the flaws and help resolve them easier. </p>
                            <h3>XiaoyuXie: </h3>
                            <p>Since the second assignment, our ability to cooperate has improved a lot and communication has become more effective. Each team member actively completes their own part, and any team member who has any problem will get help from other team members in the group. We use the same strategy as the last time to synchronise our progress in an online document in real time. If there is a problem in any part, other team members can also find out and correct the content in time. We also hold meetings at different stages to better confirm progress with each team member. In terms of mobile software page design, we also used online meetings to determine the final product that each team member was satisfied with. All in all, the group work went very well
                            </p>
                            <h3>Denzel: </h3>
                            <p>This assignment started off strong, we knew how each other worked, and were able to assign work quickly and easily for people to complete. As the assignment went on, we were much more comfortable with asking each other for help, even swapping tasks with each other if needed. Everyone brought new ideas to the project, allowing us to flesh out the more technical sides of the project. It is a great experience to work with a group of people with different sets of skills, especially when seeing how everybody thinks differently depending on the job they've been given. Time management is still something that we definitely need to improve on, as we were rarely able to get everybody together for a formal meeting, although that could be due to people getting sick. Using Microsoft Teams proved a little more difficult, as there were issues with trying to get everybody online, so we decided to meet outside of it so that we had at least planned things out. GitHub as a tool did not work for us as our project is fairly simple and using a shared document was enough, but again, I think that it is incredibly valuable for any tech related project.

                            <h3>Prerak: </h3>
                            <p>Group cooperation and help has significantly improved in comparison to the previous assignment. The project started on a strong foot with efficient meetings where work was allocated on a fair and equal basis where a due date was given and was always completed by said due date. The group was able to display our communication and creative minds through the development of artefacts and detailed description and prototyping of our project. Group assistance was also prevalent as team members would message the group requesting guidance in the group chat with members responding quickly and with effective answers. Although some issues did arise within the undertaking of the project such as issues with Microsoft teams and a lack of attendance in class tutorial, the consistency of work layout could also have been improved with different questions being answered with different layouts and in different styles rather than in a uniform manner. One major improvement would be to improve our group organisation through electing a group leader who maintains the group organisation and consistency. Overall I am happy with my group's undertaking of this project and believe we worked effectively and efficiently.

                            <h3>Zhipeng: </h3>
                            <p>I’m proud to work with these guys as a team, as they are all good members, that can allocate the task into different parts and discuss who does what part. Everyone is kind to each other and can help with any difficulties that they may come across. Personally, I was infected by Covid-19 for a whole week during the assessment, so I couldn’t attend any meetings. So one of my teammates assisted me by talking with the other team members to allocate some tasks that wouldn't be too demanding on my health. But finally, we finished our team work and learned a lot from this teamwork. Although the meetings are very funny because at almost all times, we can’t make it to some meetings and the time allocated for meetings are always changing. And I can’t join the meetings for most of the time because of Covid-19.</p>
                            <h3>Group: </h3>
                            <p>As a group we believe our best strength lies in our communication skills. Throughout the week, it was made clear that our ability to seek assistance as well as provide assistance to each other was our most valuable asset as it proved to be more valuable when we ended up finding some of the tasks confusing and difficult to accomplish. Each group member was found to be interacting with one another to provide advice on how to accomplish their set task, and to seek improvements on their work. On top of our communication skills, our initiative as a group and as individuals proved to also play a big role in the results of our accomplishments . Each person was seen to be putting in the work that was requested of them, which lead to the efficiency and quality of our work improving. The initiative to discuss projects, meet up in-person, and design the prototype was a huge help in the attempt to complete our task smoothly without trouble. Despite our group performing to the best of their capabilities, we still ended up coming across unwanted trouble. Our group had many troubles, as each individual had their own problems, with some people catching the flu going around, and with some having microsoft team issues and life commitments. We as a group were able to make up for problems that affected the group, one good example was the fact that microsoft team was having trouble opening up for some people during one of our allocated meetings and continued to fail working, and so in order to make up for not being able to hold a meeting we made time outside of class to meet up, work and discuss about the assignment. Everyone in the group can agree we all met each other's expectations throughout the assignment. Overall we are happy with the work and effort we each put into this project and hope our work was able to demonstrate this.
