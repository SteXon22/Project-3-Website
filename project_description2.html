                    <h2>Roles</h2>
                      <p>While there are many roles into the development of the app where it is vital for the completion of this project. There aren’t any specific roles where each member should prioritise on where the team will most likely tackle each problem together instead of delegating certain roles in hopes of achieving them individually. This process may take a little longer than just setting individual work; however this in turn enables greater communication and also engages in more contribution towards the project development, allowing for any decisions to be made together where there wouldn’t be any complaints. In the future, a couple of weeks from now this idea may change depending on the task at hand and roles may be assigned to different members based on their skills and level of knowledge. For now, all team members will work on the prototyping of the application. Ideas and contributions can be brought up as the team to implement any features, different uses and improvements towards the final project. The functionality can also be tested by everyone to help find any problems that occur and figure out as a whole to solve them. Where in an individual standpoint, some of these problems may not arise or be picked up. Other tasks like the design stage can be done way easier in a group than as an individual. All team members can bring up ideas on how they want to proceed with a certain approach where it may be going for this colour, shape or design. The team will function better where attendance issues can also be compensated for especially when certain team members may not complete their role successfully or in time which can be a hindrance towards the completion of the final project.</p> 
                    
                      <h2>Scopes and Limits</h2>
                      <p>This software will be an app that will be installed on your phone. This app will be designed to maximise the information that the user will obtain regarding activities they participate in that causes carbon emission. The app will contain a feature to manually record, and track their monthly carbon footprint in areas such as their usage in water and energy, as well as in areas such as travel and transportation. The app will use the information about their carbon footprint and calculate their emission presenting information categorically in forms such as water emission, electricity emission etc.<br>                                                                                                     
                        The user will be able to view a summary of their inputted data in a report that the app generates as well as show the user ways to offset their emission and how to approach the future with less carbon emission in mind. The main features that the app will contain as mentioned is the ability for users to record their carbon footprint and for the app to generate and display a summary and report regarding what their activity entails and alternative paths to cause less emission. <br>
                        Future features will include a more detailed report, the report will contain extra information such as activities in the area that can help improve sustainability or environmental organisations that can provide the user with benefits to their cause. There will also be a daily mode that will be implemented, that records your day to day carbon footprint and the ability for the user's phone to track carbon emission automatically. These features are considered to be too ambitious or too time constraining to develop and will be considered as a future update as they can interfere with the final product of the application.<br></p>
                        
                        <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
                        <p>Figma: Online prototyping tool for mobile applications to design interfaces. <br><br>
                            Mobile application design apps: (e.g. React Native, Xamarin, Appcelerator, Sencha)</p> 
                        <p>Proto.io: An alternative prototyping tool that allows development and design for interfaces for the mobile application project with minimal requirement of coding. </p>
                        <p>Xcode: developer toolset for creating apps specifically for appleOS products, includes interface design, coding,testing and debugging.</p>
                        <p>Mobile applications in our instance would most likely be hosted on platforms like DigitalOcean and Microsoft Azure. An example is the usage of MBaaS providers, like Azure mobile apps service, where this provides a cloud computing model which hosts our mobile application’s backend providing features like analytics, notifications, user authentication, data storage and much more. Which is required through data collection and tracking.</p>
                        <p>Applications require patents and copyright laws to protect the originality and prevent stealing/copying if the application goes public.
                            Licences are dependent on the software used, where they will have to be accepted if the application is designed through an already existing third party software where they have their own requirements to accept before usage. </p>
                        <p>Hardware - Example usage of “Buddy” an app development software requires access to a working operating system preferably windows where they might not offer this for apple,linux or any other similar operating systems. A functional and working phone whether it is IOS or Android. Where preferably both older and new generation to see the functionality of the application in different environments. Internet access may also be required to save data into cloud storages especially through targeting sustainable approaches and the collection of data from all users of the application. </p>
                        <p>Knowledge of basic HTML, CSS and javascript is also preferred when certain usage of softwares is required depending on which application has been decided upon. Other coding languages may be important depending on which approach has been decided upon.
    Most group members have a basic understanding of figma and its functions, where this tool was used in a different course previously to experiment and design a mobile application of some sort as an assignment.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Testing</h2>
                        <p>In order to test the app, we need to consider if the app can run itself, so we’ll use many tools to run it and see if it works or if there is something wrong and correct it first. 
                            SVN:(Cross-platform, support most common operating systems, open source, secure, efficient, data sharing)
                            SVN is an open source centralised version control system that is commonly used as a code and project management tool. In short, it is used for multiple individuals to work together on the same project, to share resources and achieve the ultimate centralised management. SVN can be understood as a library, which stores a variety of files, SVN to each file tagged to record each change in the file, so you can easily find and access the latest files.
                            Git:(Free and open source, multi-branch management is better than SVN)
                            Git and SVN are very similar in functionality, but the difference is that SVN is centralised and must be networked to work properly. But git is distributed, so git supports offline work and branch management is better than SVN. But git has a lot of commands and is complicated, not as easy to use as SVN.
                            Use such tools to modify the codes to see whether there is any wrong or improve the disadvantages of the app. Also, our developers will test this app first to see if it can work and how the app’s functions. Mostly, if the app doesn’t have any problems, we can launch a beta version and give the people we have test qualifications, and after using we’ll receive their advice on how to complete the app or improvements of the app that make it more better, more available, more powerful.
