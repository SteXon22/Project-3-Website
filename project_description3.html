                    <h2>Risks</h2>
                    <p>Our project of creating a service that offers users a way to track their carbon emissions in order to help minimise the effects of global warming is an undertaking that entails challenges and risks that the group will face.<br><br>
 
                        In order to offer our service, we decided upon creating a mobile application that delivers it. In doing so, knowledge on HTML, CSS and JavaScript are pivotal to know but due to the groups basic and limited knowledge of the languages due to our inexperience may lead to development issues arising, such as reducing the amount of features our app will have, increased amounts of bugs and thus extra time will be required in order to conduct debugging.<br><br>
                         
                        Additional issues arise not only within the software segment of our service but also in the hardware portion of our project. The app will be created on computers but is intended to be used on mobile devices and thus issues will arise due to hardware. Issues such as compatibility of the app on different mobile devices will arise, will the app be able to run on an iPhone 6? How much processing power is required to run the application, and will phones be able to handle it without draining too much battery life? These hardware issues will require extensive testing on mobile devices in order to solve the listed issues.<br><br>
                         
                        Other risks also emerge when creating an application for mobile devices such as ensuring that our design meets with UI/UX design requirements. User interface and User experience are pivotal components of an application and must be taken into consideration if our service is to succeed. For instance, functional requirements such as ensuring that the application fits within the phone are important in order to offer users the best experience possible while navigating our application. The risk of not meeting UI/UX requirements is one that must be addressed and not be overlooked by the backend and coding of the program as without UI/UX the application is doomed to fail.<br><br>
                         
                        Furthermore, due to the nature of the app requiring access to the internet and cloud storage to track, calculate, store and give a detailed report to the user the application must require a secure and stable ability to connect to WIFI and mobile data. Again, due to our inexperience with creating applications and our current knowledge on software languages there arises a risk in which the group is unable to provide an extensive internet connectivity due to our aforementioned inexperience leading to a large component of our service to be undeliverable.<br><br>
                         
                        Finally, the app requires the storage of user information and thus a major risk is presented with ensuring the security of user data and information. If user data is breached due to a lack of security implementation that does not meet Victorian standards or data is unlawfully shared for any reason whatsoever it will leave our members of the group liable to legal ramifications as we did not hold up to certain legislation such as the privacy act of 1988 which “ensure privacy settings empower consumers, protect their data” (1). The risk of not meeting legal requirements in data protection for our users is a serious risk that needs to be our main priority as there are many other legislation to do with users’ data that need to be upheld such as the Information Privacy Act 2000 (2) and Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014 (3).<br><br></p>

                      <h2>Group processes and communications</h2>
                      <p>Many groups who develop apps all fail, because they were lacking in their communication amongst team members. As time goes by the group begins to slack in keeping in touch with their team members and therefore creates a situation that is unnecessary and unwanted as some members begin to unknowingly put in no effort to keep their team up to date. To avoid this situation, our team has set up a group chat on an app that is used daily by all members, allowing for ease of use. With the use of these online communication tools we allow ourselves to communicate 3 to 5 times a week with it being vital and mandatory that we engage in a video call meeting twice a week, in order to discuss the mandates and ask for assistance in work. The tools we used are Facebook messenger and Microsoft Teams. At times, some of our group members may have some emergencies with their daily life, such as getting infected with Covid-19, being injured, or other relatively important reasons, if that is the case, they’ll communicate with other group members by using Message and the rest will assist in their workload, or reschedule a soft deadline.</p>
