                    <h3>Cyber Security Architect</h3>
                    <p>
                        A key component of our project involves storing user data and information such as their address. In order to prevent any malicious attackers from gaining such information it is pivotal that the app is secure and safe to use with the storage of information being protected by firewalls and other security blocks to prevent the loss and theft of data. In order to produce such safety measures to a high standard the project will need to hire a Cyber Security Architect.
 
                        <br><br>The Cyber Security Architect we will hire will primarily work on creating and installing firewalls, review the current security systems of the app and implement enhancements and improvements wherever possible. Additionally, the Cyber Security Architect must also create a disaster recovery procedure in the possible event a data breach does occur.
                         
                        <br><br>The Security Architect must be experienced and have completed at least a bachelors in either Information Technology or Computer Science. Additionally, applicants with extra certifications such as CISSP will be desired and will be preferred over those who don’t have certifications.
