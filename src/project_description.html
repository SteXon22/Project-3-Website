                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>In this project, we are aiming to provide people with a means to reduce their carbon footprint, and overall impact on the environment. To achieve this, we will begin to develop a mobile application that will track and/or estimate the carbon emissions of the user's actions. The application will then advise the user on steps and actions they can take to reduce their impact on the environment. <br><br>
                        By providing users with information on carbon emissions and how to reduce them, we hope that they will not only work to reduce their carbon footprint, but also be active in contributing to a greener society. <br><br>
                        Global warming and climate change have been big topics over the past few years, and is still widely debated today. We believe that there are changes that everybody can do in their lives that can help reduce humanities impact on the environment. We also understand that not everybody necessarily has the time to do research on their carbon footprint, and that making these changes can be overwhelming. By creating the mobile application, we aim to assist users with these overwhelming tasks, hopefully allowing them to continue contributing in a meaningful way.<br><br>
                        There are services online that people can use to calculate their carbon emissions. These are already fantastic tools that are available for free. Although these services are great, they do not provide many personal insights for the user to take into account. This is where our application will differ from these services - providing users with much more personal steps and tips to reduce their impact.<br><br></p>

                    <h2>Aims</h2>
                    <p>For our project idea, we will create a mobile app that can calculate the customer’s carbon footprint. To provide our customers with better environmental awareness and environmentally friendly living habits. Our first aim is to Expand more customers to our carbon footprint app. This improves sustainability and reduces the overall carbon footprint, but it also can increase our profits and keep our projects going. To meet the main aim of our project. We have a few goals for each different stage of the project. First, we're going to be a big advocate of how easily people's lives affect the environment. Let our software cultivate users' green habits. Add some daily small tasks to improve customer stickiness. </p>
                    <h4>Advertise:</h4>
                    <p>Our first goal to meet our main aim is to advertise our idea to the market. We will promote how people can use some good habits to decrease their carbon footprint through our mobile apps. For example, Carry reusable shopping bags and avoid products with too much plastic wrap. Use green energy such as solar, LEDs, and water-saving shower heads. Make sure to only buy what you need to avoid waste. Eat local and seasonal products. Those small changes can decrease the customer’s carbon footprint, the more the customer joins our program the more obvious the good effect on the environment. </p>
                    <h4>Cultivate customers’ environmental habits:</h4>
                    <p>So how does our mobile app cultivate customers’ environmental habits? Our app has a few features to help our customers. Our app can calculate the carbon footprint that each customer makes for each of the actions they do each day. For example, are they using reusable shopping bags? Are the customers using green energy such as solar power? Are they using LED lights or water-saving showerheads? our app can calculate the carbon footprint pends on those actions customers make and make a suggestion for the customer. is not a long boring questionnaire that customers need to fill in, customers can add what they do separately in a day. Our app can also make suggestions for customers on what food they can eat in 3 meals for both environmentally friendly and healthier for the customer. Customers can enter their age, height, and weight, and our app can give suggestions like eating Greek yogurt, and eggs with coffee in the morning. Also, recommend other seasonal food to decrease the customers’ carbon footprint and also good for customers’ health. If our app can supervise and guide the user's habits, this can help customers develop good living habits more quickly and efficiently.</p>
                    <h4>Improve customers’ stickiness:</h4>
                    <p>Improving customers’ stickiness is also one important goal in our aim. We don’t want our customers to forget to use our app after a long time. So how can we avoid this phenomenon? Using psychology, people are more likely to do things that are easy to do and have immediate payoffs in the short term. In our app, we will create multiple small tasks to let our customers finish, and after that, the app will give customers awards. For example, using recycled or used plastic bags for shopping, eating what the app suggests for you, enter 6 actions that affect your carbon footprint. share your daily carbon footprint result. Those tasks may change for each day. The reward can be a qualification to participate in the grand prize, points for discounts, clothing of the customer's online avatar, etc. Those small tasks will help customers continue to use our app and continue to decrease their carbon footprint. </p>
                     
                    <h2>Plans and Progress</h2>
                    <p>This project will provide people with information about their carbon footprint and help them reduce their impact on the environment. This will be done by asking the user to input their information on various categories that contribute to their carbon footprint. These categories include energy, water, transport, and waste. Once this information is acquired by the application, it will calculate their carbon footprint, and display the information to the user. The application will inform the user of targeted goals for individual carbon footprints, and then help guide them to reach those goals.<br><br>
                        The original idea for this product stems from the overwhelming amount of information that one needs to consider when looking at their carbon footprint. There are so many things that an individual needs to consider, and because of this, many people may give up or not do anything. That is why this project focuses on specific things that an individual can do, rather than general insights that can apply to everybody. The application's main purpose is to do this research for the individual, allowing them to act upon it without dissuading them from doing it.  Other inspirations for the development of this application comes from other applications and programs that allow users to track their data, such as fitness trackers. Another heavy inspiration for this application is recipe and meal planners, especially ones that plan meals in a way that reduces food waste.<br><br>
                        Originally, the project was going to be a little smaller in scope, with just providing users with general insights into their carbon emissions. Since then, we have discovered that there are already many services available online that provide the same thing, so we decided to expand the scope of the project to be a little more specific towards the individual. 
                        <h5>Progression Stages:</h5>
                        <h5>Stage 1:</h5>
                        <p>Stage one involves researching information for the application. The goal for this stage is to set our goals for the project to meet. The most important information for this project to have relates to carbon emissions, environmental impact, and targeted carbon footprint of individuals within a set of years. Other information that would be great to have is environmental initiatives that are available to users. Finally, finding other companies that would benefit from this project would also be ideal at this stage.<br><br></p>
                       <h5>Gather information</h5>
                       <ul>
                            <li>Average carbon footprint of individuals</li>
                            <li>Effects on environment</li>
                            <li>Carbon emission goals</li>

                            By companies<br>
                            By countries</a>
                            <li>Local and worldwide initiatives to actively reduce environmental impact</li>
                            <a>Replanting trees/forests<br>
                            Rubbish cleanup</a>
                            <li>Target goals in the few years</li>
                            <a>1 year goals<br>
                            5 year goals<br>
                            10 year goals</a>
                            </li>
                      </ul>

                      <h5>Stage 2:</h5>
                      <p>Stage two marks the start of actually developing the application. At this point, we have the basic ideas of the application down, and are working towards developing and visualising ideas. In this stage, we will be wireframing and prototyping the application in programs such as Figma, and Proto.io. During this stage, we can also develop a framework for our backend, such as the database structure, making the workflow for further stages easier. It is also at this stage that we will be able to assess the technical feasibility of the application, and work towards the skills needed to develop it.</p>
                     <h5>Prototyping:</h5>
                     <ul>
                          <li>Design wireframe and prototype</li>
                          <li>Design backend for easy workflow</li>
                          <li>Assess technical feasibility</li>                   
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Stage 3:</h5>
                      <p>In this stage, the first versions of the application will be created. Once the prototyping and wireframing is complete, we can start work on the backend and connect it to the frontend.</p>
                     <h5>Develop code</h5>
                     <ul>
                          <li>Use wireframe and prototype and finalise design</li>
                          <li>Finalise frontend and backend</li>      
                        </ul>
                    <h5>Stage 4:</h5>
                      <p>Once the first few versions of the application are created, we can move on to testing. We can test the application internally and find immediate issues on things such as the user interface, or any bugs that come up. During this stage, we can also hire quality testers to help with the final tests. We can also release a test version of the application to a select few people and gather feedback from them in surveys and questionnaires. Once all testing is complete and the application is finalised, we can move onto the next stage.
                        <br><br></p>
                     <h5>Testing</h5>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Test internally for immediate issues</li>
                        <a>Bugs<br>
                        UI/UX</a>
                        <li>Release application to select users for beta testing</li>
                        <a>Survey these initial users for improvement</a>
                        <li>Finalise design and features</li>                          </ul>  

                        <h5>Stage 5:</h5>
                        <p>Towards the end of the application, we can begin the marketing campaign to get users interested in the application. Some basic steps such as establishing social media and a release date are a must, but we can also hire a marketing team to help us with the campaign. The overall goal of this stage is to generate interest to gain a user base. Once the application has been released to the public, we can move onto the next stage.</p>
                       <h5>Rollout</h5>
                       <ul>
                            <li>Marketing campaign</li>
                            <a>Consult with marketing team on rollout strategy<br>
                                Publicise social media<br>
                                Set a release date</a>    
                            </ul>        
                                
                        <h5>Final Stage</h5>
                        <p>Stage two marks the start of actually developing the application. At this point, we have the basic ideas of the application down, and are working towards developing and visualising ideas. In this stage, we will be wireframing and prototyping the application in programs such as Figma, and Proto.io. During this stage, we can also develop a framework for our backend, such as the database structure, making the workflow for further stages easier.
