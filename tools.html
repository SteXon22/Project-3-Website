                            <p>I was born on November 23rd 2003 in Chicago, America to my Nepali parents who through the help of my Grandfather decided to name me Prerak which in Nepali means to inspire others. Whilst growing up I was taught the Nepali language and the traditions and cultures that my family and nation held. My most recent school was The Knox School located in Wantirna South where I hold many joyous and fond memories of my schooling experience. Whilst attending the school I played the Tenor Saxophone in the school's Jazz and concert band. I also played soccer for 11 years and only recently stopped to pick up Brazilian Jiu Jitsu or BJJ for short at Immersion MMA at Glen Waverley</p></div>

I came to Australia when I was 19, I used to be a design student in the Deakin college, after I study half year of it I think Information system is more suitable for me, then I change my school to RMIT to study Information system. I also had a part time job for 3 years after I arrived in Australia. I used to work in supermarket, restaurants. Now I am a salesperson for SmartUser, which is a company doing government programs. Those part time job experiences help me improve a lot and I’m looking for a practice job in the future. </p></div>

                            <p>My name is Steven Hy and my ethnicity is Chinese. Despite being Chinese I grew up surrounded by Vietnamese culture as both my parents grew up in Vietnam and moved to a vietnamese neighbourhood in Australia, at home I speak Cantonese with my parents. I am currently both studying and aiming to complete a degree in the Bachelor of IT which I hope can assist me in getting a job. Outside of work and university I like to spend my leisure time playing games such as Valorant or any new upcoming titles that interest me. Apart from playing video games I enjoy organising time to spend with my mates, going out for lunch or dinner and just socialising in general.

                                <p>I was born in the Philippines and in 2003, our family moved to Australia as dad had many job opportunities as an aircraft mechanic. In my free time I enjoy reading - mostly fantasy and sci-fi but I am also a sucker for horror stories, I also play video games - some competitive games such as Valorant but mostly action-adventure games like Dark Souls. My interest in technology stems from my love of video games. When I was younger, I played a lot of computer games and was interested in how they were made. I eventually found out about software development, and started working my way towards it. Along the way, I became interested in other fields related to technology and I am very excited about what is in store for the future. Apart from this, I was also really good with the home computer, and became the go to for any technical problems my parents had with it.</p></div>

                                    <p>Hi, my name is Haosheng (Alvin) Huang. I was born October 2003, currently 18 and originally from China however I moved to Australia at the age of 4. Since I moved to Australia at an early age I am not as fluent in Mandarin, but my Cantonese is slightly stronger, and I can read, write and converse better in “canto.” I often did go to Chinese school on the weekends to build my Chinese, but it did not work as well as I hoped, considering my Mandarin is still inadequate. I’m currently aiming to hit top 500 on valorant where it is my main game that i play. I played a lot of basketball throughout my schooling days for about 4 years where I recently stopped due to the pandemic situation. The only pet I ever owned was a rabbit called bun where the hardest part about owning a pet is to clean up their mess. I am currently a student at RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) studying IT (Information Technology)
